    "Slope and Intercept are estimated using the least squares method, minimizing the sum of squared residuals. Distance measures how far a data point deviates from the predicted value, following the principles of linear regression. The Outlier Criterion identifies significant deviations from the regression model by comparing the squared distance to a scaled average distance. This approach helps in flagging data points that do not conform to the expected relationship between volume and weight."
